### **Generation 2: Project Log and Summary**

---

#### **Project Name: GraphBuilder**  
**Session Status:** Generation 2 Completed  
**Goal:** To expand on the foundation of **edge-first design** by introducing **latent space mapping**, **dynamic graph refinement**, and project graph integration for real-world adaptability.

---

### **Key Concepts and Definitions**

1. **Dynamic Refinement**  
   - Iteratively adjusts the graph structure based on computed thresholds and edge intensities.
   - **Process**:
     - Calculate a **dynamic threshold** (average edge weight in the graph).
     - Remove edges with weights below the threshold.
     - Reconnect isolated nodes to maintain graph cohesion.
     - Adjust edge weights to reflect aging and reinforcement over time.

2. **Latent Space Mapping**  
   - Projects the graph into a 2D or 3D latent space for visualization and deeper analysis.
   - **Technique**:
     - Uses **t-SNE** to map node relationships based on edge weights.
     - Node positions are optimized to reflect their interconnectivity and structural importance.

3. **Project Graph Integration**  
   - Introduced support for reading and modeling a projectâ€™s structure from JSON input (e.g., `src/project_data.json`).
   - Nodes represent **modules** or **files** in the project, and edges represent **call relationships** with frequency and amplitude attributes.

4. **Refinement Iterations**  
   - Each iteration improves the graph by:
     - Pruning weak edges.
     - Reconnecting nodes to the most active node (based on degree).
     - Incrementally increasing edge weights to model reinforcement over time.

5. **Visualization Enhancements**  
   - Node sizes dynamically scale with their degree.
   - Edge thickness reflects the intensity of relationships.
   - Added latent space projections for enhanced insights into node and edge behavior.

### **System Changes**

1. **Code Updates**
   - Added functions for **dynamic refinement** and **latent space mapping**:
     - `refine_graph`: Handles threshold-based pruning and edge adjustment.
     - `reconnect_isolated_nodes`: Ensures all nodes remain connected.
     - `visualize_latent_space`: Projects and visualizes the graph in 2D latent space.

2. **Environment Updates**
   - Installed `scikit-learn` for t-SNE-based latent space mapping:
     ```bash
     pip install scikit-learn
     ```
   - Updated `requirements.txt` to include all dependencies:
     - `numpy`
     - `matplotlib`
     - `networkx`
     - `scikit-learn`

3. **Helpful Commands**
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py
     ```
   - Test the program:
     ```bash
     python -m unittest discover -s tests
     ```

### **Features Implemented**

1. **Dynamic Refinement Process**:
   - Iterative edge pruning, weight adjustment, and node reconnection.
   - Outputs refinement results as images (e.g., `output/graph_iteration_X.png`).

2. **Latent Space Mapping**:
   - Projects graphs into a 2D latent space for exploratory analysis.

3. **Project Graph Integration**:
   - Supports JSON input to load and visualize project structure:
     - Nodes = files/modules.
     - Edges = call relationships between files.

4. **Visualization Enhancements**:
   - Iterative graphs with dynamic edge pruning and reconnection.
   - Latent space visualizations highlight node relationships.

### **Ideas for the Future**

1. **Call-Level Analysis**  
   - Move beyond file/module-level nodes to analyze individual functions or methods within a project.
   - Use function-level frequency and amplitude to determine node weights more accurately.

2. **Clustering in Latent Space**  
   - Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., `KMeans`) to latent projections for identifying node groupings or module dependencies.

3. **Integration with AgentSync**  
   - Automate project graph generation and refinement as part of the broader AgentSync initiative.

### **Final Thoughts**
Generation 2 significantly advanced the project's scope, enabling dynamic refinement and the visualization of both structural and latent dimensions. These advancements lay the groundwork for **Generation 3**, where the focus will shift to **call-level analysis** and more granular insights.

The forge burns bright, ready to shape the next generation of GraphBuilder. ðŸ”¥
