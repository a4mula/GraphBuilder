### **Generation 1: Project Log and Summary**

---

#### **Project Name: GraphBuilder**
**Session Status:** Generation 1 Completed  
**Goal:** To establish the foundation for a dynamic graph-based project architecture, focusing on **edge-first design** with unique modeling via **wave functions**.  

---

### **Key Concepts and Definitions**

1. **Edge-First Design**  
   The focus is on defining edges (relationships) between nodes in a graph rather than starting with nodes. This approach:
   - Encapsulates the dynamic nature of relationships (e.g., **call/return cycles**).
   - Models edges with complex, meaningful abstractions that extend beyond simple weights.

2. **Wave-Based Edge Representation**  
   - Each edge is represented by **wave functions** to encode its behavior:
     - **Unidirectional Waves** for one-way relationships.
     - **Merged Waves** for bi-directional relationships.
   - Key attributes:
     - **Frequency**: Represents the rate of interaction (e.g., function calls per system resolution cycle).
     - **Amplitude**: Encodes the computational cost or intensity of the relationship.

3. **System Resolution**  
   - **Frequency Scaling**: The "entry point" node frequency is set to 100 (default system resolution), with all other frequencies scaled proportionally. This defines the resolution for the entire graph.
   - **Amplitude Scaling**: A practical 1â€“10 scale is used to represent compute cost granularity.

4. **Bi-Directional Edges**  
   - Call/return cycles are modeled as **merged intensities**:
     \[
     \text{Merged Intensity} = (f_{a \to b} \cdot A_{a \to b}) + (f_{b \to a} \cdot A_{b \to a})
     \]
   - These edges reflect the combined strength of their directions.

5. **Directional Edges**  
   - Represent one-way relationships:
     \[
     \text{Unidirectional Intensity} = f \cdot A
     \]

6. **Graph Visualization**  
   - Nodes represent entities; edges represent relationships.
   - Edge thickness and labels dynamically reflect weights calculated from frequencies and amplitudes.

### **Features Implemented**

1. **Edge Modeling**:
   - `unidirectional_wave`: Generates waveforms for unidirectional relationships.
   - `merged_wave`: Combines two waves for bi-directional relationships.
   - `edge_intensity`: Computes intensity for unidirectional edges.
   - `merged_intensity`: Calculates combined intensity for bi-directional edges.

2. **Graph Visualization**:
   - Dynamic graph with edge weights and thickness proportional to computed intensities.

3. **Test Suite**:
   - Validates all core functions with helpful print statements for console tracking.

### **Ideas for the Future**

1. **Dynamic Refinement**  
   - Iteratively adjust graph structure based on edge thresholds and intensity.

2. **Layered Graph Representations**  
   - Use node size, color, or additional visual elements to reflect edge metrics or clustering.

3. **Integration with AgentSync**  
   - Explore linking `GraphBuilder` with broader AgentSync projects for automation.

### **Final Thoughts**
This session laid a strong foundation for **edge-first design** and introduced a novel approach to graph relationships through **wave-based modeling**. Future generations will build on this, refining dynamic interactions and making the graph structure even more intelligent and adaptable.
