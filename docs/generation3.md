### **Generation 3: Project Log and Summary**

---

#### **Project Name: GraphBuilder**  
**Session Status:** Generation 3 Completed  
**Goal:** To achieve **function-level granularity** in graph analysis, dynamically integrate **call relationships**, and refine latent space visualizations to better represent project structures.

---

### **Key Concepts and Definitions**

1. **Function-Level Analysis**  
   - Transitioned from module-level nodes to **function-level nodes** for a more granular representation of project behavior.
   - **Metrics Extracted**:
     - **Line Count**: Indicates function size and complexity.
     - **Argument Count**: Reflects the complexity of function signatures.
     - **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Captures branching and decision points.
     - **Nesting Depth**: Represents structural depth within functions.
     - **Docstring Presence**: Highlights documentation coverage.

2. **Dynamic Call Relationships**  
   - Identified relationships based on **function calls**, both within and across modules.
   - **Attributes**:
     - **Frequency**: Call frequency inferred from structural analysis.
     - **Amplitude**: Calculated using function size and complexity metrics.
   - Relationships dynamically form the graph's **edges** with weights derived from these attributes.

3. **Graph Refinement at Function Level**  
   - Iteratively refined the graph based on call relationships:
     - Pruned weak edges below a **dynamic threshold**.
     - Reconnected isolated nodes to the most active (high-degree) nodes.
     - Adjusted edge weights to model **aging** and reinforcement over iterations.

4. **Enhanced Visualization**  
   - Improved latent space projections with **function-level granularity**:
     - Node positions dynamically reflect interconnectivity and importance.
     - Function names and relationships visually mapped for clarity.

### **System Changes**

1. **Code Updates**
   - **Function-Level Analysis**:
     - Extracted and analyzed all functions in the project using `ast` to gather metrics and detect relationships.
   - **Relationship Extraction**:
     - `find_function_calls`: Parses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to detect function calls within and across modules.
     - `build_graph_from_relationships`: Constructs a directed graph from extracted call relationships.
   - **Visualization Enhancements**:
     - Graphs now reflect function-level relationships and weights.
     - Latent space mapping projects nodes with enhanced fidelity.

2. **Environment Updates**
   - Updated `requirements.txt` to include:
     - `numpy`
     - `matplotlib`
     - `networkx`
     - `scikit-learn`
   - Example installation command:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Helpful Commands**
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     PYTHONPATH=. python src/main.py
     ```
   - Analyze project structure:
     ```bash
     PYTHONPATH=. python extract_structure.py
     ```
   - Test the program:
     ```bash
     python -m unittest discover -s tests
     ```

### **Features Implemented**

1. **Function-Level Granularity**:
   - Extracted detailed metrics for all functions in the project.
   - Modeled function relationships dynamically as graph edges.

2. **Dynamic Call Relationships**:
   - Incorporated intra- and inter-module relationships.
   - Derived edge weights from frequency and amplitude attributes.

3. **Latent Space Projections**:
   - Enhanced latent space mapping with function-level resolution.
   - Improved clarity of node positions and relationships.

4. **Graph Refinement**:
   - Iterative pruning and adjustment of relationships based on function-level data.
   - Visualization of refinement iterations as part of the analysis process.

### **Ideas for the Future**

1. **Automated Weight Calculation**  
   - Automate frequency and amplitude inference for nodes and edges based on real-world project data (e.g., profiling or telemetry).

2. **Clustering and Grouping**  
   - Explore clustering techniques (e.g., `KMeans`) to identify function groupings and potential module boundaries in latent space.

3. **Interactive Visualizations**  
   - Enable dynamic interaction with visualizations to explore relationships and edit graph structures in real time.

4. **Integration with Broader Projects**  
   - Integrate GraphBuilder into AgentSync for dynamic project analysis and tracking.
